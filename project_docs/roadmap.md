# Minima Enhancement Roadmap

## 1. Cross-Document Relevance Enhancement
**Goal**: Transform search from single-document matching to comprehensive knowledge discovery using Qdrant's payload capabilities

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Enhanced Qdrant payload implementation
  - Design payload schema for Obsidian features
    - The payload should include fields for:
      - `file_path`: The path to the Obsidian note.
      - `chunk_id`: A unique identifier for the text chunk.
      - `heading`: The heading of the section the chunk belongs to.
      - `tags`: An array of tags associated with the note.
      - `links`: An array of links to other notes within the vault.
      - `created_at`: The creation timestamp of the note.
      - `modified_at`: The last modified timestamp of the note.
    - Consider using nested objects for complex metadata.
  - Document-to-document relationship tracking
    - Store links between documents in the `links` field of the payload.
    - Use a graph database or similar structure to efficiently query relationships.
    - Consider storing backlinks as well.
  - Efficient metadata storage structure
    - Use appropriate data types for each field to minimize storage space.
    - Index fields that will be used for filtering.
    - Consider using a separate collection for metadata if necessary.
  - Payload-based scoring configuration
    - Use payload fields to boost or penalize search results.
    - Allow users to configure scoring based on metadata.
    - Consider using a combination of vector similarity and payload-based scoring.

- [ ] Enhanced context window system
  - Cross-document context aggregation using payloads
  - Reference tracking through stored relationships
  - Custom scoring using payload data
  - Optimized payload querying

- [ ] Query understanding improvements
  - Payload-aware query processing
  - Filter generation from Obsidian syntax
  - Context-aware query expansion
  - Efficient payload-based filtering

### Success Metrics
- Improved multi-document query results
- Faster cross-document relationship traversal
- Better handling of Obsidian-specific queries
- Reduced system complexity

## 2. Chunk Parameter Optimization
**Goal**: Optimize text chunking for better context preservation

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Chunk size analysis framework
  - Test suite for different content types
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Automated parameter testing

- [ ] Dynamic chunking system
  - Content-aware chunk boundaries
  - Semantic unit preservation
  - Overlap optimization

### Success Metrics
- Reduced context fragmentation
- Better preservation of semantic units
- Improved search precision

## 3. Diversity Scoring Implementation
**Goal**: Ensure search results cover different aspects of the query

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Diversity scoring algorithm
  - Topic diversity measurement
  - Source diversity tracking
  - Time-based diversity consideration

- [ ] Result ranking enhancement
  - Balance between relevance and diversity
  - Dynamic diversity threshold
  - User preference integration

### Success Metrics
- Increased result variety
- Better coverage of different aspects
- Improved user satisfaction metrics

## 4. Result Deduplication
**Goal**: Remove redundant information from search results

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Similarity detection system
  - Content similarity scoring
  - Semantic similarity detection
  - Near-duplicate identification

- [ ] Deduplication pipeline
  - Configurable similarity thresholds
  - Content merging strategies
  - Metadata preservation

### Success Metrics
- Reduced result redundancy
- Cleaner search results
- Better information density

## Timeline Considerations
- Cross-document relevance: 4-6 weeks
- Chunk parameter optimization: 2-3 weeks
- Diversity scoring: 2-3 weeks
- Result deduplication: 1-2 weeks

## Resource Requirements
