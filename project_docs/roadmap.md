# Minima Enhancement Roadmap

## 1. Cross-Document Relevance Enhancement
**Goal**: Transform search from single-document matching to comprehensive knowledge discovery using Qdrant's payload capabilities

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Enhanced Qdrant payload implementation
  - Design payload schema for Obsidian features
  - Document-to-document relationship tracking
  - Efficient metadata storage structure
  - Payload-based scoring configuration

- [ ] Enhanced context window system
  - Cross-document context aggregation using payloads
  - Reference tracking through stored relationships
  - Custom scoring using payload data
  - Optimized payload querying

- [ ] Query understanding improvements
  - Payload-aware query processing
  - Filter generation from Obsidian syntax
  - Context-aware query expansion
  - Efficient payload-based filtering

### Success Metrics
- Improved multi-document query results
- Faster cross-document relationship traversal
- Better handling of Obsidian-specific queries
- Reduced system complexity

## 2. Chunk Parameter Optimization
**Goal**: Optimize text chunking for better context preservation

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Chunk size analysis framework
  - Test suite for different content types
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Automated parameter testing

- [ ] Dynamic chunking system
  - Content-aware chunk boundaries
  - Semantic unit preservation
  - Overlap optimization

### Success Metrics
- Reduced context fragmentation
- Better preservation of semantic units
- Improved search precision

## 3. Diversity Scoring Implementation
**Goal**: Ensure search results cover different aspects of the query

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Diversity scoring algorithm
  - Topic diversity measurement
  - Source diversity tracking
  - Time-based diversity consideration

- [ ] Result ranking enhancement
  - Balance between relevance and diversity
  - Dynamic diversity threshold
  - User preference integration

### Success Metrics

- Better coverage of different aspects
- Improved user satisfaction metrics

## 4. Result Deduplication
**Goal**: Remove redundant information from search results

### Key Deliverables
- [ ] Similarity detection system
  - Content similarity scoring
  - Semantic similarity detection
  - Near-duplicate identification

- [ ] Deduplication pipeline
  - Configurable similarity thresholds
  - Content merging strategies
  - Metadata preservation

### Success Metrics
