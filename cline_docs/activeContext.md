# Active Context

## What you're working on now
Testing the BAAI/bge-m3 reranker implementation and analyzing its performance.

## Recent changes
- Tested reranker performance with various query types:
  - Technical system queries
  - Semantic variations
  - Cross-document queries
- Identified key areas for improvement:
  - Result deduplication needed
  - Cross-document relevance could be enhanced
  - Query result diversity could be increased

- Fixed the .minimaignore implementation by making the path handling consistent within the container.
  - The .minimaignore file is now loaded from the container path (/usr/src/app/local_files/) where the files are actually mounted.
  - Path matching is done consistently using paths relative to the container mount point.
  - Added debug logging to help troubleshoot pattern matching.
  - Added better error handling for path operations.

## Next steps
Explore integration of Obsidian-specific features to enhance cross-document relevance:
- Leverage internal links ([[note]]) for explicit relationships
- Use tags (#tag) for semantic grouping
- Extract YAML frontmatter for structured metadata
- Implement backlink-based relevance scoring
- Support hierarchical tag relationships (#parent/child)
