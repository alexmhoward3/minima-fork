# Progress

## What works
- Basic indexing functionality is working
- The indexer.py properly ignores files in the .minimaignore file
- BAAI/bge-m3 reranker implementation shows:
  - Good semantic understanding
  - Hardware acceleration support (MPS/CUDA/CPU)
  - Integration with vector search infrastructure

## What's left to build
- Implement result deduplication
- Improve cross-document relevance
- Add diversity scoring for results
- Fine-tune chunk parameters (currently 500/200)

## Progress status
The project is in active development with reranker testing complete and improvements identified.
