- Sensitivity issues doc
- Tuli Musau
- [[Lead Project Writer trial]] - kinda holding on this while we get a point of view on our larger digital content needs.
	- do both 
	- ethan wants to talk about where we need resourcing, but we could pitch larger DE resources in addition to the pilot project
- Feedback on the last quarter; what role do you see me playing right now and in the next 3 months?
	- #feedback you're doing great
	- Don't be so tentative - i'ts my opinoin that...these are the benefits...
- When i think abou tthis year and our digital presence (website and newsletter and social): that exists from a monetization perpsective, those exist to drive partnerships; our no-regrets content pitch is driving traffic (audience, for ex growing US audience)

## Mar 12, 2024
- What can i do to make this easier on you? Have an optional call tomorrow morning with the DEs, but not sure if folks will join
- Think this is a good opportunity for
Our value is access to experts; right now the format that the experse takes is our books. If you think about a news network, it's the anchors. but what happens when the anchor has a newsletter or podcast? We can be that convener of an expertise; maybe our product is about video itineraries, a concierge service while youre in destination 
we need to build something that people can't travel without
nilay patel - decoder and the verge redesign making content fun
updates to article templates, destination pages, POIs, itineraries are no-regrets changes that we should make\
We're lucky to have an advocate in paul and ethan that know time is our best ally so we can build the best product possible

Good chat confirming that now's not the time to try to push for a return for single-source commissioning. focus on what's right for the product vs what is doable using the tools we have.

## Feb 29, 2024
- What‚Äôs going on with the design team? Two designers leaving rather suddenly. 
- Is there a director who you think is really nailing it? Interested in growing into this role so would love your ideas on what the gold standard is

- Piers's idea of more in-destination DEs

## Feb 7, 2024

- [x] #read_later [Growth Loops: How The World‚Äôs Best Brands Build Growth](https://nogood.io/2019/10/01/growth-loops/) ‚úÖ 2024-01-31

## Dec 19, 2023
- I'm tracking what I see as your big projects for are 2024, but I want to confirm them so I can follow where I can support
	- Getting our Taxonomy Right - loving the conversation here and think it's definitely key to building something right.
		- Nitya:  when i get confused, i step back and ask myself "what is the big picture" and then i see if these details fit that.
	- Content packaging and design - this became clear to me after the [[Work/03-Resources/Meetings/2023/12-December/2023-12-06 Listicle Templates + Blocks Follow Up Discussion]] 
		- Nitya: No brand book, so everything becomes a debate
	- Books to Digital - biggest open question for me as I sense interest in AWS flagging.
	- How can i help
		- Nitya: maintain situational awareness on how digital product impacts content
		- Nitya: I can better appreciate the ambiguity than brekke
			- have a vision of what we're building towards conceptually
- Update on the Replacing Christo question, as much as i don't want to derail Dan Moore's good efforts getting Christo improved, there's no PM and I'm worried the current scope is limited in form.
- Wanted to make sure this meeting cadence is working for you. You've been incredibly gracious with your time and want to acknowledge that but also give you an out if you're too busy. 
	- Finding myself occasionally struggling with being remote and think this is a good opp to stay connected, but...

Be prepared on amy lynch

#### Product changes
- Sounds all like we're in the right direction, and I never know whether to actually raise questions/concerns in that Leadership meeting because I know it can sometimes spiral, though I think you did a great job setting up that context of a reach goal.
- Funny that as i was taking notes during that [[Work/03-Resources/Digital KPIs for 2024]] recording, i wrote down a question "We need a confirmed strategy for POIs" and then immediately after you had your "no POI panic" comment

I have an opportunity that i want to put in front of you. I've been evaluating your strengthsa dn where the company is and a place where i think there's an opportunity for you to grow. It's not negative; when i think about your strengths and what the company needs. This is a role that you can shape; it's good to have an intrisitc idea of how the books are made and the modern internet. Knows the book process but can Lead the crafting of a new role. Cna develop a structured set of content, but also develop innovation. Contribute to the newsletter more; have a bit more fun. 

We aren't adding ten heads, we're trying to rearrange the talent to give our biz opportunity. The biz would benefit from more sarah. 

Have her talk to Laura, Brekke. 
- [x] Set up a time with Brekke, look at the JD for morgan ‚úÖ 2023-12-08

#### Org Structure
- would love to build this up as a situation in which we could allow folks like Dan and Sandie to continue their work in contributor recruitment and product development, respectively. Might mean we need to shift our regions around a bit
	- Do we rethink Dan's region to give him space to focus on recruitment (not sure if he even feels the need for more time)?
- Where does [[Morgan Wegner]] ?
- Melissa seems keen, which is good. What's the roadmap for Sarah?
- Piers' proposal was for three time-zone Senior DEs - Doc, Melissa and Fin.
- Has Fin been contacted/told?
- Annemarie to manage the Dublin office 
- Nitya to talk to Brekke about Fin

## Nov 15, 2023
[[Reorg strategy]]
Spoke to Sarah and floated the idea of her working on daily/experimental content, and she's definitely down for it, but i didn't go too much deeper into detail because i wanted a bit firmer ground/more time to really get into what that might mean. We talked about some of her books next year, and she's definitely got her head in the game with getting them done, but recognizes that she won't be doing much for 6 months

### How we're thinking about a reorg
What is the biz need?
	- publishing need, agressive need
	- digital product
- This aligns under laura two teams:
	- publishing biz (under [[Alex Howard]] )
	- digital destination team (brekke)
		- we assign digital destination team to destinations, ex
			- ann douglas is americas
			- fin is europe
			- sarah stocking
		- Two categories of content
			- digital core content
			- franchise content (experimental)
		- **each set of regions has a digital minder**
		- Fin can set digital expectations/own it, do books to digital translation where needed, can work with the DEs in their print production dips/valleys
	- Brekke has been very successful with newsletter and daily with production workflow/schedule - this is a great way to extend that skillset
	- Alex H has been great at understanding how the pipes are connected and this is an opp to give the destination team some gubernatorial support, and Alex can support some of the content strategy of those pages, the CMS's connections
How are we using our skill set
- Sarah has a lot to offer; that was not the right setup for her
	- Can say: this type of workload iddn't work, but we know that this type of workload did
	- To sarah: hey we're thinking about this, does this interest you? If it was you
	- Been thinking a lot about what you've been reflecting on what's been this hard, and the time you thrived; feel like there's an opportunity with the way we're thinking about product, and i think there's a way to lean into your strengths. 
- Melissa Yeager: loves project management, lives in the West Coast, wants to manage people
- Need to validate with brekke that this hypothesis is correct

- Five digital product workstreams that I'll be working on/involved with #strategy : 
	- Destination experience/hubs
	- Marketplace (search) - how do i filter, tagging and taxonomy
	- signup, profiles and authO
	- Trip planning tool - smaller part
	- Content templates and structured templates

### [[Evan Godt]]  and destination content org
Been thinking a lot about restructuring the content org to include Evan in the destinations team, and I really do think it'd help with some of our data asks/content insights. It stood out to me that Evan was the only one not actively/closely engaged with the content he was covering (though he did have a lot of interesting points and did a great job!). 

Bringing him closer to the work of thinking about the digital destination content and where it fits with the rest of the content org might be good. I think we could both work more closely together on what the strategy is and what our needs are.

[[Destination Team Org.canvas|Destination Team Org]]

### [[Sarah Stocking]] 
Sent some review-oriented questions about her work over the past year, and she got very anxious about it. From my POV, she's hit her deadlines, but still struggles with time/task management. I need to review her book projects to see how they went, but i imagine they required slightly more work than the average DE. 

She also mentioned some family and health stuff that was preventing her from working to her full potential. I talked to [[Kathleen Amilca]] last week, and she suggested that we put the question back to sarah: what do you need to be successful. She also suggested that she review Lyra. 

Sarah has some space in her schedule, so have asked her to follow up with Morgan on setting up Asana in a way that works for her, connecting with Caroline on Workflow improvements and maybe shadowing Sandie.

I have a call with [[Laura Motta]] tomorrow where we'll align on my direct reports, so will spend some time with her on this. But interested in your birdseye view on it.

Find another task that is very organized - ask Laura.
If one of the things we're talking about is, how do we start to turn the volume up on digital destinations content? Can we grab Sarah.

For the Americas - we need new energy in the mix. Caroline's introverted, Alicia's great. What we're missing in the mix is someone who could be a US based Deputy who can have a vision on how can we turn up the volume on Americas content. Help me execute my vision for the US coverage.

Caroline not coming into the office

our leadership team should focus as one whole person. You have to know who you are and where your gaps are and then think about the people you have to fill those gaps to build out your vision. For me, Laura and annie are very good at strategy and execution. Brekke really understood digital content production - build a calendar, how is content performing. 

Think about leadership team as 
It's like you're playing chess, thinking about who's on the board, and where you're using them. 

Alicia: i'm going to coach you into X role, for the next 6 months, 

With the SEO convos, there might be a way to establish them as a US deputy over US digital content

[[Building a team]]

- [ ] discuss with #Personnel/Laura : needs for digital content US coverage - what does a US Deputy Digital Editor look like? What would their responsibilities/attributes look like? üìÖ 2023-10-31
