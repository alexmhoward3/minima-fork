# Note of gratitude to Amy


## Prompt/context
I want to Send a Note of gratitude to Amy acknowledging that she had biggest cascade, cc'ing sandie, Nitya, Piers and Paul - explain what a cascade is (briefly) a. celebrate her b. establish myself to Paul as a leader of the team

## Draft
Hey Amy, 

I know it was mentioned at the All Hands this week, but really wanted to celebrate your year. Just looking at your guidebook commissions:
- 26 titles in your region, PLUS you took on Africa 15 to lend Zara a hand - a huge title in itself. 
- Also wanted to shout out how the titles were stacked: 18 were all due in the same month (June) - in a role that can be peaks and valleys, you had a giant peak
- In total that's 7,884 pages, 85 contracts and at least 170 payment requisitions. 
Plus you had time for:
- Weekly product development sessions with Sandie and the development group
- Press trips to Finland, Guyana, East Cork, Greenland and Scotland (and accompanying articles!)
- Conferences in Ireland and Mallorca (tough gig!)
- And just generally showing up when we needed you.

Thanks again, Amy. Here's to another great year!
