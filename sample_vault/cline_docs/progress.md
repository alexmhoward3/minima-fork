# Progress

## What works
- Core functionality:
  - Basic indexing and search
  - File ignoring via .minimaignore
  - BAAI/bge-m3 reranker implementation
  - Document chunking with configurable strategies
  - MCP server integration
- Development environment:
  - Docker with hot reload
  - Environment variable configuration
  - GPU acceleration setup
  - Volume mounting for live development
- Obsidian features:
  - Built-in metadata extraction
  - Tag parsing from frontmatter and inline
  - Proper timestamp handling
  - Standardized metadata format
- Search improvements:
  - Enhanced metadata relevance scoring
  - Configurable chunking strategy
  - Multiple result handling (in progress)

## What's left to build
High priority:
- Complete multiple results implementation in MCP query tool
- Optimize reranker token handling
- Fix type handling in parameter passing

Medium priority:
- Improve cross-document relevance
- Add diversity scoring for results
- Enhance metadata boosting algorithms
- Add environment validation for all services

Low priority:
- Implement backlink tracking
- Add advanced Obsidian query syntax
- Optimize memory usage for large collections
- Add environment variable documentation
