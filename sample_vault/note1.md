#### üïî EOD Review
Goals|Relationships|Projects|Ideas|Connections|Context

Big day, very busy. Good update in the morning with [[Brekke Fletcher|Brekke]] and the SEO team - feel pretty proud of that.

Reviews have got me thinking: I need to be better about recording my own wins & projects - crazy that I took all these notes and still found it a struggle. That shows the kind of year it's been. Very aimless at times. #reflection #work

Good chat with [[Daniel Bolger|Dan]] - need to get moving on getting the [[ROW DEs]] in my line. Dan otherwise seems like he's in a good mood. He'll be happy with the 4.

Great session with [[Nitya Chambers|Nitya]] about the team. Think she appreciates my approach. #leadership #team

Doc - good chat, got some tactical details sorted, and he filled me in on what's going on with the ME & SE roles. So [[Karen Henderson|Karen]] more on layout, less on copyediting scheduling. Makes sense, but the book designers haven't exactly been productive. Could give her focus. But now I need to sort out how to involve her in the GDE role. Maybe it's put her and [[Sandie Kestell|Sandie]] together - Karen to work out layout practicalities & Sandie for commissioning + product input. #work #planning

## üõå Evening review
Good day. Lots done at work, and a really good conversation with [[Nitya]]. I keep thinking about that video and what could have been better (the thank you video). I think it was fine but missed on messaging - it should have directly called out editors and the background could have been better. Live and learn, to use the cliche. 

I do sense a changed relationship with the [[DE]] team though - not entirely because of the [[Sarah Stocking|Sarah]] thing last year but maybe? Again, live and learn. Hope we can get good outcomes for everyone this year.

I've got it in my mind to blame the [[Sarah Stocking|Sarah]] thing on [[Laura Motta|Laura]]. To a certain extent, she blocked me from talking directly with [[Nitya Chambers|Nitya]], and I was surprised when she brought up the newsletter stats from 2022. But who cares really - she's in a better spot. Maybe I'll pull the [[Laura Motta|Laura]] cord if we catch up over drinks.

Anyway, kids were a mess at pickup. Wanted to go to the wagon. [[William]] lost a shoe; was he cold, [[Maggie]] starting up over a snack. I said we were leaving and [[Maggie]] flipped out. Ran around in the parking lot, fighting about getting into the car.

Later, [[William]] wanted glue. We'd already done the bedtime routine, but [[Danielle]] got him a glue stick. Later he came up with a series of paper strips glued end to end. He called it a ship string.
