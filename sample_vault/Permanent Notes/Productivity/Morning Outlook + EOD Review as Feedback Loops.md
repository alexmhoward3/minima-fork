Use the Morning Outlook/plan as a way to [[Prioritize daily highlights around deep focus work]]. Then EOD to review that plan. The result is a positive feedback loop for productivity and wellbeing.

The goal of agenda setting at the beginning of the day and review at the end of the day is to assess if the goals you set out were successful. If they were, then the day can be considered a success. If not, then review what derailed your plans and adjust for tomorrow.
