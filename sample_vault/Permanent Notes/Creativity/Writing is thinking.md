## Work as if writing is the only thing that matters

The purpose of research is to produce public knowledge - for that to happen it has to be written down. 

[[The Digital Garden]] 

"Working with the garage door open"

If you live your life as though you were working toward publication, you'll read differently, becoming more focused on the parts most relevant to the argument you're building. You'll ask sharper questions, no longer satisfied with vague explanations or leaps in logic. You'll naturally seek venues to present your work, since the feedback you receive will propel your thinking forward like nothing else. You'll begin to act more deliberately, thinking several steps beyond what you're reading to consider its implications and potential.

- You'll read differently: focused on the parts most relevant to the argument you're building.
- You'll ask sharper questions: not satisfied with vague explanations or leaps in logic
- You'll want to present your work: the feedback you receive will sharpen your thinking
- You'll act more deliberately: think several steps beyond what you're reading to consider its implications and potential.

### Potential outcomes
- Maybe not exactly a digital garden, but something akin to the [[Thought leadership at LP]] idea from a while back.
- Certainly present ideas to my team and leadership more often.
