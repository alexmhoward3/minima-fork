## Core Concept
True creativity doesn't come from rigid planning but rather the expertise gathered by extensive research and notetaking. This expertise allows for the flexibility required to be creative, allowing the seamless transition from analysis to open-minded exploration.

## Elaboration
Traditional advice for writing emphasizes the importance of structure and organization - eg make an outline. But this can be limiting. Instead, developing expertise in a field provides a more powerful system of creativity due to its flexibility

- expertise allows for mental flexibility; experts can switch from analysis to open-minded creativity seamlessly
- creativity requires both divergent and convergent thinking - the ability to generate many ideas at once (divergent thinking), and then focusing on just the right ideas (convergent thinking)
- rigid planning can restrict the flexibility needed to explore new ideas or develop new insights
- expertise facilitates improvisation - spontaneous, informed decisions that often surpass made-up plans
- learning is better than planning - focusing on becoming an expert encourages learning and adaptation, which is better than rigid plans

## Connections and Implications
- [[Writing is thinking]]
- [[Standardization enables creativity]]
- [[Growth mindset]]

## Questions and Further Exploration
- How can one develop the ability to switch from open and focused mental states?
- How can organizations foster environments that value expertise and flexibility over rigid planning?
- What are the risks associated with abandoning planning entirely, and how can they be mitigated?
