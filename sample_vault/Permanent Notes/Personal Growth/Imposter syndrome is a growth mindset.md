## Core Concept
Imposter syndrome is often a negative feeling, but it can be a positive indicator of a growth mindset

## Elaboration
Imposter syndrome is characterized by feelings of self-doubt and anxiety, a fear of being exposed as a fraud despite general success:
- these feelings arise when people are pushed beyond their comfort zones and engaging with new challenges
- the discomfort associated with imposter syndrome is often a result of self awareness of one's own limitation and potential for growth
- people experiencing imposter syndrome are often high achievers in relatively new positions of challenge and/or those who have high aspirations for themselves and their performance

## Connections and Implications

- [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]] - a contrast to Imposter syndrome in which a those with limited competence have tendency to overestimate their abilities
- [[Good friction]] and [[Productive struggle]] - imposter feelings can be seen as a source of positive friction and productive struggle

## Questions and Further Exploration
