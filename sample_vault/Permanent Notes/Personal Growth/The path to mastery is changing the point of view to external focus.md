## Core Concept
The true master thinks not just about the task at hand, but how his actions are perceived externally, especially by those who consume or interact with the master's work.

## Elaboration

### Internal vs External focus
- Internal focus: individuals evaluate their own performance, skills and methods internally. It's introspective, emphasizing self-assessment, personal improvement and mastery of techniques from a personal standpoint.
- External focus: involves considering how others perceive your performance, effectiveness, and the value you provide. It emphasizes the impact on consumers, clients, team members, or stakeholders.
### Path to mastery through external focus
- Enhanced empathy and understanding: by prioritizing how others view your work, you become attuned to their needs, expectations and feedback. This empathy can drive improvements that align more closely with what consumers or team members value.
- Improved communication and collaboration: especially in high-stakes environments, understanding the external perspective fosters better teamwork. Recognizing how each team member contributes to the overall perception and outcome can enhance coordination and effectiveness.
- Adaptability and Responsiveness: an external focus enhances flexibility. Staying attuned to external feedback means that experts can adapt their methods
