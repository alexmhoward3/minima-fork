## Core Concept
Betterment is decreasing the gap between desired outcomes and current outcomes by focusing on the single most painful problem or most impactful solution.



## Elaboration
If your current outcomes are lower than the outcomes you wish you were getting, they're the natural result of all the choices you've made interacting with the competitive environment. They probably aren't going to get a whole lot better unless you make a different set of choices to make the gap between your desired outcomes and current outcomes go away.

First thing to do: what is the most painful gap that i'm currently facing? For ex, customers used to do this, but now they're doing that.

Use a cascade: Can i change where I'm playing? Can I change how i'm winning? Can i change my capability, my management systems?

Don't try to solve all problems at once, that's perfection.

Betterment is making the gap go away.

An example could be a professor who's been teaching for several years. Every year he polls his students on what they thought of each lecture. Whatever lecture that comes in at the bottom of the sentiment survey gets dropped.

Key question: What are the biggest gaps between what you *wish* was happening and what *is* happening?
	Follow up question: what different choices could we make to cause the gap to go away?
	Before putting those choices into action, go to the second biggest gap and ask what different choices you could make to cause that gap to go away. Then consider those two choices: if the two sets of choices are consistent, great! Then move on to the third choice, etc. 
	But if the choices between the first and second gap are in conflict with each other, then you must revisit the choices of the two gaps to create a new set that are compatible and address both the biggest and next biggest gap.
	Then move on to the third gap, etc

This is all to avoid "strategy perfection", which has the tendency to chase an unrealistic strategic ideal that replaces the status quo. In contrast, the betterment idea focuses on the journey of eliminating outcome gaps. 

Additionally, focusing on one gap at a time makes the strategic problem more tractable and attainable. Teams can get overwhelmed by the task of strategizing from scratch in search of the *perfect strategy*. Essentially it's the strategic equivalent of "Don't let the perfect become the enemy of the good enough."
