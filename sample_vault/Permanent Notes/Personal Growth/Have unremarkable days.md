## Core Concept
It's OK to settle or realize that what you thought you wanted was just a mask for self fulfillment. My time spent wanting to be a writer was some of the more frustrating and upsetting periods of my life (is this true?). It was OK that I found a job that wasn't what i initially wanted. 



## Elaboration
[[Albert Camus]] believed that the core tension in life stems from the indifference of the universe. Existence itself doesn't have meaning, and the concept of the absurd arises out of the conflict between our desire for meaning and the meaningless of the universe.

We must embrace the absurd and rebel against it, he said. In [[The Plague]], the main characters embrace the absurd onset of an outbreak and choose to fight against it, finding purpose in their actions.

I take a similar but gentler approach, more in line with true existentialism which one must create meaning in a meaningless universe.

The [[Millennial messaging]] was that one could be anything, the meritocracy was real and self-expression was pure. This turned out to be false. This is the absurd.
