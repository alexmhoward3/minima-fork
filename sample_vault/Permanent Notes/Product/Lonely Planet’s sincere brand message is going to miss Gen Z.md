[This TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNsyo7bU/) suggests there are post-millennial trends that are bucking the idea that sincere authenticity is a driving decision force. 

Brands aren’t going to fix the world. COVID showed us that the “we’re all in this together” idea was generally bullshit. People want their brands to be purposeful, meaning they don’t want to be identified with brands that are actively destroying the planet. But brand purpose as this self-important, cringey messaging is out of style

People want their brands to be fun, silly, with less specificity and more in-group interpretation to the meaning, which leaves simple messaging open to a wider set of variable meanings. That’s why political messaging has been reduced to “[[republicans are weird]]” and not “republicans are a threat to democracy.” Brat summer is fun, a little contrarian but ultimately open to several interpretations. 

What’s replacing sincerity is consistent chaos, an organized set of activations that showcase brand codes through a set of seemingly chaotic or unhinged moments. KFC’s brand codes 11 spices, bucket shapes and red/white colors are presented through a variety of strange collabs - a dating app, a meditation app, crocs etc. “because if you’re going to sell me something like fried chicken, do me a favor and at least create a spectacle for me

What are lonely planet’s brand codes? Human, utility, blue etc

What does this mean for travel? Not every trip has to be a life changing experience. It can simply be a treat when you can’t buy a house and a beer costs $18. 

Counterpoint: one area where this isn’t quite playing out is fashion. Workwear is still pretty popular, suggesting a clinging to the sincere ideal of “honest work”. Indeed even relaxed silhouettes are in, as if to say my clothes are functional and comfortable due to my commitment to an authentic aesthetic. 

Normcore is still relevant. The Walz pick was normcore to the max, sincerity and dad culture in one go.
