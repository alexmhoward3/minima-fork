## Core Concept
Active listening is essential to improve relationships and improve communication.

## Elaboration
Active listening is both outward and inward, using body language and attention to hear what the other person is saying and communicate that you are listening deeply.

- Focus: 
	- Maintain eye contact
	- Avoid distractions (this may mean avoid taking notes)
- Use nonverbal cues to demonstrate that you're focused
	- maintain an open posture
	- nod occasionally
	- use facial expressions to show you're listening
	- avoid backchanneling ("yeah" or "i see" or "uh huh") when on [[Zoom]], but it's good when in person
- Don't interrupt
- Ask [[Deep Questions]]
	- "Can you tell me more about...?"
	- "What do you mean when you say...?"
	- "How did that make you feel?"
	- Ask deep questions that touch on values: Did you always want to be a lawyer

	- "So what you're saying is.."
	- "If I'm understanding correctly..."
- [[Give good feedback]]
