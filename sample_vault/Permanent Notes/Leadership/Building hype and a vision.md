It's on you (the leader) to have a pulse on how everyone else is feeling about that product. It's important for leadership to amp the company up to focus on a project or conviction. 

Gaining conviction boils down to aligning on assumptions

## Four characteristics of a vision that inspires

> Does your vision inspire? There are four characteristics to ensure it does. First, it focuses on what isn’t, not what is. Second, it’s exponential, not incremental. Third, it’s risky, not stupid. Fourth, it’s focused on what, not how.

> Why these four? Remember our definition of vision at the start of the book: it’s an inspiring, clear, practical, and attractive picture of your organization’s future, one superior to the present. If your vision of tomorrow is more or less the same as today, it fails on all points. You’ve got to ensure your vision goes beyond today and prompts action toward tomorrow.
