An established corporation establishes a #moat, compounds advantages. Startups do something different - [[Lenny's Podcast  Product   Growth   Career - Pattern Breakers  How to find a breakthrough startup idea   Mike Maples, Jr. (Founding Partner at Floodgate, ex-Product at Silicon Graphics)]]

Startups take advantage of #inflections, or a point in time in which something new is introduced that empowers customers - eg the Iphone 4s shipped with a GPS chip, which allowed Uber to take shape. Smartphone cameras getting better enabled Instagram.

## Objectives
Always have a focal point, a north star. Everything benefits from a focal point - photography, travel, business. High achievers benefit from having a focal point  [[Coaching for Leaders - 677  How Leaders Can Better Support High-Achieving Women, with Sohee Jun]]
## Customers

- If you have data and an anecdote, usually the anecdote is right - 
- Before you start talking to customers, have a perspective on what you think is true. Have a point of view on what the customer will say to make them excited to use the product. Articulate a clear hypothesis. This gives directions to #research and helps interpret the data you gather effectively. Don't become overly attached to the hypothesis
- Strategy isn't an ambitious goal or a set of financial outcomes. It's a coherent plan for how you would apply ==your strengths== against a core and important problem. Aspirations or vague statements like "to re-invent banking" are not clear strategies. Clear strategies are detailed plans centered on specific problems, solutions, customers and strengths.

> This is why "traffic growth" is such a frustrating strategy. There's no detailed plan focusing on a specific problem.
> It's not even that it's a frustrating strategy; it's a business objective without a strategy. At almost every turn, editorial leaders have said "we'll keep doing what we're doing; this is mostly a tech problem."

> Maybe what i should do is just write something up - eg if "traffic growth" is what our goal is, here's digital editorial's strategy. But the question is, how do i navigate this politically? Brekke will get overwhelmed, and her team will be cordoned off. Laura's mostly useless. Nitya's a good bet, but I'll have to present something to her that's either fleshed out or at least has the bones of a plan.

## Disruption
[[Lenny's Podcast  Product   Growth   Career - Be fundamentally different, not incrementally better   Jag Duggal (Nubank, Facebook, Google, Quantcast)]]
If you want to disrupt, you have to search for what is fundamentally different. Incrementally better doesn't get you there. You have to reinvent or create new categories.

## "Tar pit ideas"
[[Lenny's Podcast  Product   Growth   Career - Lessons from 1,000+ YC startups  Resilience, tar pit ideas, pivoting, more   Dalton Caldwell (Y Combinator, Managing Director)]]
- Beware of "tar pit ideas": ideas that receive initial positive feedback but may lead to long-term challenges. Often seem appealing and solve what appears to be an unsolved problem. However, despite the positive feedback and validation, they can become difficult to pivot away from once their limitations become apparent. Example: an app to coordinate with your friends to decide where to go out at night or where to meet up. 

## [[Competitor Analysis]]
[[Lenny's Podcast  Product   Growth   Career - Kunal Shah on winning in India, second-order thinking, the philosophy of startups, and more]]
Delta 4 concept of measuring products with competing products: measure your product's efficiency (read by how efficiently it moves a customer from A to B) on a scale of 1-10. Then measure your competitor. Yours has to be four points higher. For ex: Uber's efficiency vs a taxi is 9 vs 3.
