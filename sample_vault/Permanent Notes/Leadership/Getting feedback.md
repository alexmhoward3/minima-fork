Getting better at what we do is motivational, and we can only get better when we receive feedback.

Feedback can be 
- External - from presenting your work to someone else
- Internal - distinguishing the bits that truly matter from those that don't. 

Feedback also helps us determine what we can get done in a given amount of time - if we consistently measure what we've accomplished, we can adjust our future expectations
