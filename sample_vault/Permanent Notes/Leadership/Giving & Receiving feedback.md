[[Radical Candor  Communication at Work - Radical Candor “Asks” Jeff Wetzler  The Foundational Skill of Asking Questions 6   26]]
- Ask the right questions, even if you think the answers might be obvious
- Request feedback in the right way: "what is your reaction to what I just said?"

## Giving feedback
- to give feedback, ask for it first
- if you're not asked for feedback but have some to give, start by asking questions. This can help avoid giving advice for the wrong perception/situation.
