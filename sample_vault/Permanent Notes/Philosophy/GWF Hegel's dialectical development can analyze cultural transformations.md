Hegel's dialectical development says transformation happens in 3 phases: thesis, antithesis and synthesis. The status quo (the thesis) will be confronted with its opposite (the anthesis), and the resulting change will be a synthesis.

Counterpoint: this is an oversimplification [according to some. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/4gm5bs/historical_examples_of_hegels_dialectic/) It's more that the thing (thesis) contains its opposite within itself. A good example is the concept of freedom in Liberalism. Freedom is used to justify emancipation of certain groups (slaves, workers), but the concept is also used to oppress (eg the freedom of capital owners to oppress their workers)
